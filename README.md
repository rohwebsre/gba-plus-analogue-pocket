# GBA Plus Specification

**GBA Plus** is a open specification for a dual-mode FPGA core targeting the Analogue Pocket.

- **Legacy Mode**: Cycle-accurate GameBoy Advance (240x160, 16.78MHz, 4 DMA, 40 sprites).
- **Plus Mode**: Extended execution environment (1600x1440 framebuffer, 33MHz CPU, 6 DMA, 64 sprites, 2MB VRAM).

This repo contains the specification only - no implementation yet. The goal iss to rpovide a clear, open foundation so FPGA developers and retro-computing enthusiasts can build on it.
